The goal was to extract valuable insights on sales trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency through comprehensive SQL queries, including various joins, functions, and aggregations.

Key Features:

Dataset Analysis: Leveraged an open-source pizza sales dataset to perform detailed SQL queries.
SQL Mastery: Applied a range of SQL functions and complex joins to uncover meaningful insights.
Tools & Technologies: SQL Workbench for query execution, data manipulation, and analysis. 
Outcome: This project not only sharpened my SQL skills but also provided a deeper understanding of how data can be transformed into actionable insights. The project is documented thoroughly, with all queries and results available on GitHub.
